# SchoolProject
A Java OOP project to register a student and calculate their average. I  developed this solution in HackerRank's 30-day code challenge. 
I really liked the result and decided to post it on my GitHub to keep it updated ^^. I think I'll do it more regularly. After all, I'm programming on HackerRank every day. 
It doesn't cost to create a repository with my solutions to the problems. And, I'm trying to apply the suggestions in the Clean Code book 
(I haven't finished reading it, if you find any errors of mine that could be repaired to improve the "cleanliness" of my code, feel free to send an Issue or a Pull Request!
